# RelaxApp


An open source Relaxing sounds app, built purly out of spite that most noise maker apps on the appstore have egregious onboarding proccesses that take far too long, and
even charge yearly subscription fees for simple audio playback. The app is my first app onto the store and i've learned so much from it. If you would like to see the app
on the store ill provide a link below
